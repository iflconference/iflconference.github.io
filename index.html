    <h1>International Symposia on Implementation and Application of Functional Languages</h1>

    <p>This is the web-site for the International Symposia on
    Implementation and Application of Functional Languages -- IFL. The
    name was changed in 2004 to add the term application, and from
    2006 the title was changed from Workshop to Symposium, in line
    with similar events such as LOPSTR or TFP. These changes reflect
    both the broader scope IFL has gained over recent years, the
    long-standing production of a high-quality and respected refereed
    post-proceedings, and an increasing trend towards moving
    functional languages out of the research laboratory and into the
    real world.</p>

    <p>The first workshop on the Implementation of Functional
      Languages on Parallel Architectures was held in Nijmegen, the
      Netherlands in 1989. IFL has run as an annual international
      event since then. From 1996, a selection of the best papers
      presented each year has been published by Springer-Verlag in
      their Series of Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). These
      papers are selected by a rigorous post-facto refereeing process
      to form a formal proceedings of the workshop, with papers
      undergoing two rounds of revision before publication.</p>

    <p>The scope of the symposia covers all aspects of the
      implementation and use of functional programming languages,
      including but not limited to: compilation and interpretation,
      abstract machine design, parallel and concurrent implementation,
      automatic program generation, novel applications, tools and
      techniques, program analysis, runtime profiling, memory
      management, type checking, computer architectures, array
      processing, debugging and tracing, language concepts,
      verification and formal aspects. The current symposium
      description will contain more precise details and guidance.</p>
